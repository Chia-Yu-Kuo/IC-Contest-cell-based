# IC-Contest-cell-based
There are some code completed with my teammate Tsai,Chi-Yu during the day before IC-Contest 2023, including university(E) and graduate(B) groups.    
Note: In graduate(B) groups final, we only complete to synthesis stage(no APR), and more than 95% of the works reached Level A.
